MyFitnesspal App is a very specifc app centered around improving your fitness. It specialises in building good workout plans and diets, concentrating on building muscle mass and losing body weight. Whilst it is very good at providing information on the things it specialises in, i.e creating diet plans and workout plans. It does not provide a comprehensive guide for all of our test cases. For instance Marie who has Osteoporosis and joint pains and who wants to target increased bone density will not get the information on how to do this on this app, and will need to seek information on this elswhere. However, James who is a fitness enthusiat and specifically wants to increase muscle mass and improve on his diet will get great use of this app, as it has resources that will calculate his optimal calorie intake and a vast catlogue of nutritional information on different food types. Even calculating the calorie intake from a cheesburger based on where you obtained it i.e a cheesburger from costco is 420 calories and one from lidl is 257 calories.
For our third test case Sarah, who wants to lose weight but also suffers from back pain, she will be able to make some use of this app specifically in her goal to lose weight but again the topic of resolving health issues(i.e. her bad bac) is not covered in this app and she will be need to go elsewhere for further information on these types of topics.

In summery I find that this app is very useful for perople who have specific fitness goals such as losing weight or gaining muscle, but as it does not advice for people who suffer from health issues, it really only targets a very specific subset of people.
